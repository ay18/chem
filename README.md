*Chem* is our end-of-semester project for a class with an overarching theme to explore untraditional platforms (read non-desktop). This project incorporates Unity 5 and Leap Motion to create an app which parses [.sdf files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file) and presents those molecules in 3D. The user can then interact with the molecule using hand gestures, such as to view the molecule from different angles.
